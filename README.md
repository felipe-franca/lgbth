# **LGBT Helper**

The mobile application that will be developed will include devices that will inform LGBT homeless people to find places and NGOs that can help them or even shelter them, in addition to informing this population in cases of homophobia and transphobia and directing them to numbers useful for receiving assistance from public safety as well as informing public laws that defend the LGBT community
